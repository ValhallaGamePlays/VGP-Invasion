    Valhalla Game Plays Presents: VGP INVASION Volume 1
Greetings! This map pack is a Valhalla Game Plays community project centered around the idea of preserving old Skulltag game modes and extending the life of Doom II by ID software. We begin with our paying homage to one of the most popular skulltag game modes; invasion! There are very few who make invasion maps these days. We seek to change this...
Please feel free to use this map set as an example/resource for your own invasion map.
    
    A lot of the actors/textures here come from Realm 667.
