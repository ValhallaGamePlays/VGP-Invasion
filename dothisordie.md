screenshots are in mapnchill discord group
turn sphere respawn off
nerf scrags or remove if we cant  

//map01has a misaligned texture, more ammo 

map02 move spheres, turbosphere is in the wrong spot, boss is easily stun locked  

map03 misaligned textures, monsters get stuck in hallways, lighting is poor, make new torch actor with better gldefs  

map04 Ceiling, monster spawning rooms need to be widened, quad damage respawns too fast  

map05 boss scales to the wrong size, should be bigger. weapons need to be made more visible from where they are placed 1 hellsmith per wave, less big wizards per wave  

map06 less drones, teleport is jank possibly remove it block teleport lines Dark imp area is poorly lit Monsters easily get stuck Ammo is scarce, wave 5 door needs to open all the way Golden boner is fucked, instantly dies  

map07 fix invincible spots drones really tone down amount of enemies Not respawn in further back areas more monsters that spawn in the new areas vent area has too much same texture elevators are useless if they dont come back up  

//map08 is fucked, dont know why probably too many things  

map09 music too short, Texture on top of texture, refer to screenshot, map moves up and down for some reason instead of gates opening, Fix rocket jumping spots, More texture variation and lighting   

map10 fix shotgun guys, way too stronk. Open up mid, widen hallways  

map11 fix boss, needs to be switched out, fucks the whole world. More weapon spawns  

map12 Only one monster at present, possibly change music to another megaman series song. More weapon and ammo spawns  

For some reason when the final map completes the server hangs
